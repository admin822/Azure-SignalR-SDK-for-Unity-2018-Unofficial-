# Azure-SignalR-SDK-for-Unity2018
Since currently there is no Azure SignalR SDK for Unity 2018, I followed the instructions given in MS docs and created my own.(Sure you can build it yourself, here is the full instuctions:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/cross-platform/unity-scripting-upgrade?view=vs-2019)

# Who will find a need for this:
Any developer who desires to build a SignalR client in his/her Unity2018 project using the ASP.NET CORE SignalR Client SDK

# How to use it:
Put the 'Plugins' folder into the 'Asset' folder of your Unity2018 project. Yeah, simple like dat.
